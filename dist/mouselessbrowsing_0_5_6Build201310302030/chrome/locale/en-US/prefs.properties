mouselessbrowsing.exclusiveNumpad.help=Input via the numpad is exclusively processed by MLB. I.e. even if the focus is on an text field the input via the numpad is interpreded as ids. There are two exceptions to this rule: First the Add- and the Subtract key is not blocked as the key codes for these keys are the same as the ones on the "normal" keyboard area. Second if the focus is on a select box the input could not be blocked at all.

For other formelements the ids are positioned at the right margin of the element.\nEnabling smart positioning extends the time for initialization as some more calculations are necessary.  
mouselessbrowsing.omitSmartPosForCheckboxAndRadio.help=If selected no smart positioning for checkboxes and radio buttons will be applied which reduce the initialization time especially for pages with lists including checkboxes for every list item (e.g. Gmail).
